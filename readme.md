Based on iOS VPN Profile Generator by Kris Linquist (@klinquist). 

24-March-2019: Updated to include **Payload Organization**. I didn't like seeing 'Unknown' in the iOS VPN settings.

17-May-2019: Added additional version that includes the ability to set profile configuration name. This makes it easier when looking at the list of installed profiles on your phone.
